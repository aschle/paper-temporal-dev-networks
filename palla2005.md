# Uncovering the overlapping community structure of complex networks in nature and society
*Palla, Derenyi, Farkas, Vicsek*

* The existing deterministic methods used for large networks find separated communities, whereas most of the actual networks are made of highly overlapping cohesive groups of nodes.
* overlaps are significant, and the distributions we introduce reveal universal features of networks
* web of communities has non-trivial correlations and specific scaling properties

## Definition community
* parts in which the nodes (units) are more highly connected to each other than to the rest of the network (are called: clusters, communities, cohesive groups, modules)
* most real networks are characterized by well-defined statistics of overlapping and nested communities
* has never been studies for large networks

## Basic quantities
* node `i`
* **membership number** `m_i` ... number of communities the node `i` belongs to
* any two communities `A` and `B` can share `s_ov` nodes ... **overlap size** between these communities
* communities constitute a network (each community is a node, links are overlaps)
* **community degree** of a community is called `d` ... number of such links
* **size of community** `s_com` is defined as number of its nodes
* to characterize community structure of network we introduce the distribution of these four basic quantities

## Cummulative distribution functions
* `P(m)` ... number of communities a node belongs to (membership number)
* `P(s_ov)` ... number of nodes two communities share (overlap size)
* `P(d_com)` ... degree of a community-node (communiy degree)
* `P(s_com)` ... size of community (communiy size)
* `P(s_ov)` means  the proportion of thos overlaps that are larger than `s_ov`

## Formal definition of community
* a typical community consists of several complete (fully connected) subgraphs that tend to share many of their nodes
* **`k`-clique community:** union of all `k`-cliques (complete subgraph of size `k`) that can be reached from each other through a series of adjacent `k`-cliques (where adjacency means sharing `k-1` nodes)
