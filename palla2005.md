# Uncovering the overlapping community structure of complex networks in nature and society
*Palla, Derenyi, Farkas, Vicsek*

* The existing deterministic methods used for large networks find separated communities, whereas most of the actual networks are made of highly overlapping cohesive groups of nodes.
* overlaps are significant, and the distributions we introduce reveal universal features of networks
* web of communities has non-trivial correlations and specific scaling properties

# Definition community
* parts in which the nodes (units) are more highly connected to each other than to the rest of the network (are called: clusters, communities, cohesive groups, modules)
* most real networks are characterized by well-defined statistics of overlapping and nested communities
* has never been studies for large networks

# Basic quantities
* node 'i'
