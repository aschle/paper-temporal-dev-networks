# Uncovering the overlapping community structure of complex networks in nature and society
*Palla, Derenyi, Farkas, Vicsek*

* The existing deterministic methods used for large networks find separated communities, whereas most of the actual networks are made of highly overlapping cohesive groups of nodes.
* overlaps are significant, and the distributions we introduce reveal universal features of networks
* web of communities has non-trivial correlations and specific scaling properties

## Definition community
* parts in which the nodes (units) are more highly connected to each other than to the rest of the network (are called: clusters, communities, cohesive groups, modules)
* most real networks are characterized by well-defined statistics of overlapping and nested communities
* has never been studies for large networks

## Basic quantities
* node `i`
* *membership number* `m_i` ... number of communities the node belongs to
* any two communities `A` and `B` can share `s_ov` nodes ... *overlap size* between these communities
* communities constitute a network (each community is a node, links are overlaps)
* *community degree* of a community is called `d` ... number of such links
* *size of community* `s_com` is defined as number of its nodes
* to characterize community structure of network we introduce the distribution of these four basic quantities
