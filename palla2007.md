# Quantifying social group evolution
*Palla, Barabasi, Vicsek*

* We have developed an algorithm based on clique percolation that allows us to investigate the time dependance of overlapping communities on a large scale, thus uncovering basic relationships characterizing community evolution.
* networks capturing collaboration between scientists and calls between mobilde phone users
* large groups persist longer if they are capable of dynamically altering their membership
* small group: condition for stability is that their composition remains unchanged
* knowledge about time commitment of members can estimate lifetime of community
* dynamics of small and large groups

## Data
* 142 month, monthly list of publications, 30.000 authors
* 52 weeks of phone calls of one mobile phone company, 4 milion users

## Network Characteristics (local structure)
* co-authorship: dense network, overlap between communities, long term collaboration process
* cell-phone: less interconected, seperated by inter-community nodes/edges, instant communication

## Method
* communities were extracted using the clique persolation method ...
